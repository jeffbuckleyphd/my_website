    "text": "I am a Lecturer in Research Pedagogy in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest and Visiting Senior Lecturer in Technology Education in the Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning at Linköping University. I am the current Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Technology and Design Education and the Series Editor for the Emergent Directions in Engineering Education book series, both published by Springer Nature. I am also an Associate Editor for the European Journal of Engineering Education, an Advisory Board Member for Educare, and an Editorial Board Member for Educational Psychology Review, SN Social Sciences, and The Educational and Developmental Psychologist. I received my PhD in education and communication in the technical sciences from KTH Royal Institute of Technology in 2018.\nI study and conduct research broadly in technology and engineering education, but am particularly interested in the role of spatial ability in learning, the use of adaptive comparative judgement in educational assessment, and inclusivity with respect to gendered experiences and stereotypes. I also conduct meta-research with the aim of improving research practices broadly within technology and engineering education research.\nI teach modules in Research Methodology, Academic Writing, and Research Ethics to Doctoral and Masters students in Faculties of Engineering, Science, the Social Sciences, and Art and Design, and am generally interested in postgraduate students in their research journeys."
